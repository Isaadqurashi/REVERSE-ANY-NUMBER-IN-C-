# REVERSE-ANY-NUMBER-IN-C-
This C++ code prompts the user to enter a number, then utilizes a while loop to reverse the digits of the input. The reversed number is constructed by repeatedly multiplying the existing reversed value by 10 and adding the last digit of the original number. The process continues until the original number becomes zero.
